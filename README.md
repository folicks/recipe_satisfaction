## introduction

To use effective study strategies or to make another ramen noodle pack.
A personal problem of mine at least(Felix) is finding the time to cook at home.
When you're doomscrolling and finding a good recipe thinking one day you'll make it
then you realize souffle probably isn't a weekend meal. Ergo we 


## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis






you found the 2nd step in creating a github webpage
heres an example of entire website written in markdown

goal find normal distribution of number of steps and length of time for recipe
|   recipe_id |   rating |
|------------:|---------:|
|       40893 |        5 |
|       85009 |        5 |
|       85009 |        5 |
|      120345 |        0 |
|      120345 |        2 |




## Assessment of Missingness

(see 12/4 notebook)

## Hypothesis Testing

Part 1 Step 4:
1st hypothesis
- null : The distribution of minutes is not correlated with the number of steps
- alternative : The distribution of minutes is positively correlated with the number of steps
- columns : ["n_steps","minutes"]
- test statistic : absolute mean difference (comparing the recipe ratings with and without the tag)



(see 12/8 notebook)

## Framing a Prediction Prediction


## Baseline Model
only add a written part with scores (ðŸ˜­)

## Final Model


in the example final they used segments of the tags they had cleaneed

so
